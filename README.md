# VirtualMaster Play store Description
Virtual Master runs another Android System on your device, based on our Android on Android Virtualization Technology.

With Virtual Master, you can have another Android System running on your device, isolated from the Android System of your device.
The new Android System is equivalent to a Parallel Space, or a Virtual Phone, similar to a Cloud Phone, but runs locally.
In the new Android System, you can install its own Apps, arrange its own Launcher, set its own Wallpaper, and customize it as your needs.
You can run multiple Android Systems in Virtual Master, One for Work, One for Game, One for Privacy, and enjoy more fun on one device.

It's an Android Virtual Machine, just like your another phone!

1. Play with multiple Social or Game Accounts at the same time
Games and Apps are cloned after being imported into Virtual Master.
We support almost all Social Apps and Games, meaning you can have dual WhatsApp, Sharechat, Snapchat, FreeFire, and more.
You can sign in to multiple Accounts at the same time on one device and switch between them freely.

2. Run multiple Apps or Games at the same time
We support background running, that means the Apps and Games can keep running when in background.
So, for example, you can run a game in Virtual Master, but watch a video on your device at the same time.
Just like bringing the emulators such as Bluestacks and Nox to your device.

3. Support Vulkan
We support Vulkan in the Virtual Android System, so you can run many high-end games smoothly in Virtual Master.
